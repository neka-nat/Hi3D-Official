<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Abstract
Despite having tremendous progress in image-to-3D generation, existing methods still struggle to produce multi-view consistent images with high-resolution textures in detail, especially in the paradigm of 2D diffusion that lacks 3D awareness. In this work, we present High-resolution Image-to-3D model (Hi3D), a new video diffusion based paradigm that redefines a single image to multi-view images as 3D-aware sequential image generation (i.e., orbital video generation). This methodology delves into the underlying temporal consistency knowledge in video diffusion model that generalizes well to geometry consistency across multiple views in 3D generation. Technically, Hi3D first empowers the pre-trained video diffusion model with 3D-aware prior (camera pose condition), yielding multi-view images with low-resolution texture details. A 3D-aware video-to-video refiner is learnt to further scale up the multi-view images with high-resolution texture details. Such high-resolution multi-view images are further augmented with novel views through 3D Gaussian Splatting, which are finally leveraged to obtain high-fidelity meshes via 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both novel view synthesis and single view reconstruction demonstrate that our Hi3D manages to produce superior multi-view consistency images with highly-detailed textures.

## ðŸŒŸ Hi3D-codes

***ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We have released the training code for the first and second stages. You can easily modify our code to finetune Stabel Video Diffusion for the image-to-video task (first stage) and the video-to-video task (second stage).***

### Use Docker
```bash
docker build -t hi3d .
wget https://huggingface.co/hbyang/Hi3D/resolve/main/ckpts.zip
unzip ckpts.zip
cd ckpts
wget https://huggingface.co/hbyang/Hi3D/resolve/main/first_stage.pt
wget https://huggingface.co/hbyang/Hi3D/resolve/main/second_stage.pt
```

```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -v ./:/workspace/ hi3d /bin/bash
```

### Preparation for inference
1. Install packages in `environments.yaml`. Or install following the way of the [generative-models](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models) GitHub repo. We test our model on a 80G A100 GPU with 11.8 CUDA and 2.0.1 pytorch. But inference on GPUs with smaller memory (=10G) is possible.
2. Download checkpoints [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j_NEG2CPhFeRetYziWK6Qe62R5h7lG_V/view?usp=sharing) and unzip.
```angular2html
unzip ckpts.zip
```
3. Download first stage checkpoints [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z506Fdst31rCOSq5c3COydN-j4KxRdif/view?usp=sharing) and put in in ckpts/.

### Inference
1. Make sure you have the following models.
```bash
Hi3D-Official
|-- ckpts
    |-- metric_models
    |-- dpt_hybrid_384.pt
    |-- first_stage.pt
    |-- ViT-L-14.ckpt
    |-- second_stage.pt
    |-- open_clip_pytorch_model.bin
```
2. Run Hi3D to produce multiview-consistent images.
```bash
### 1. First stage
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python pipeline_i2v_eval_v01.py \
    --denoise_checkpoint "ckpts/first_stage.pt" \
    --image_path "demo/3.png" \
    --output_dir "outputs/3"
### 2. Second stage
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python pipeline_i2v_eval_v02.py \
    --denoise_checkpoint "ckpts/second_stage.pt" \
    --image_path "demo/3.png" \
    --output_dir "outputs/3"
```
### Training
1. You can refer to the [Syncdreamer](https://github.com/liuyuan-pal/SyncDreamer) repository for data preparation, but our data requirements are 1024x1024. We only provide an [example dataset](https://huggingface.co/hbyang/Hi3D/blob/main/datas.zip) here. Download the example dataset and unzip.
2. First stage training: First, download the checkpoints from [SVD](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt/blob/main/svd_xt_image_decoder.safetensors). Then, modify the model.ckpt_path in the train-v01.yaml file to point to the location where you downloaded the checkpoint.
```bash
python train_ddp_spawn.py \
    --base configs/train-v01.yaml \
    --no-test True \
    --train True \
    --logdir outputs/logs/train-v01
```
3. Second stage training: First, use tool_make_init_svd_to_vid2vid.py to adapt svd_xt_image_decoder.safetensors from SVD to fit our configuration, primarily because we need to concatenate depth information. Then, modify the model.ckpt_path in the train-v02.yaml file to point to the location where you placed the modified file.
```bash
### modify svd to fit our config
python tool_make_init_svd_to_vid2vid.py
### training
python train_ddp_spawn.py \
    --base configs/train-v02.yaml \
    --no-test True \
    --train True \
    --logdir outputs/logs/train-v02
```
